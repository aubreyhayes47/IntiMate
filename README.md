# IntiMate: Reviving the Thrill of Omegle with Private AI Chats

## Overview

Remember the wild, unpredictable thrill of Omegle—those late-night random video chats with strangers that could spark anything from a laugh to a flirty encounter? **IntiMate** rekindles that nostalgic rush in a modern, private, and ethical way. This fully on-device AI video chat simulator delivers uncensored, NSFW interactions with realistic, AI-generated female avatars, eliminating the need for real human performers. Running entirely locally on your mobile device, IntiMate ensures total privacy with no cloud dependency, no data storage, and no cost. Each session connects you with a randomly selected virtual companion who reacts in real-time to your camera and microphone inputs, capturing Omegle’s spontaneous vibe while keeping interactions short and fleeting to avoid emotional attachments.

**Primary Use Case**:\
IntiMate is for adults seeking a private, unfiltered video chat experience that echoes Omegle’s random stranger connections but without human involvement. It offers a guilt-free, AI-driven alternative for adult-oriented chats, providing a safe space for exploring fantasies with no exploitation or external data sharing.

**Tagline**: "IntiMate: Omegle-Inspired AI Chats—Private, Uncensored, and Always Offline."

- **Total Privacy and Offline Operation**: All processing (AI, visuals, audio) happens locally, ensuring no data leaves your device.
- **Pre-Rendered 2D Avatars**: A hidden library of photorealistic, pre-made avatars ensures instant session starts, smooth performance, and low battery usage for quick 5-10 minute chats.
- **Free and Accessible**: No subscriptions, ads, or internet required, designed for seamless mobile performance.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK**: Version 3.24+ (install via flutter.dev).
- **Target Devices**: Modern iOS or Android devices with sufficient processing power for on-device AI.
- **Development Tools**: Android Studio (for Android) or Xcode (for iOS).
- **Dependencies**: Listed in `pubspec.yaml` (run `flutter pub get` to install).

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/IntiMate.git
   cd IntiMate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Build and run:

   - For Android: `flutter run --device-id <android-device-id>`
   - For iOS: `flutter run --device-id <ios-device-id>`
   - For sideloading (due to potential NSFW app store restrictions): Build APK/IPA with `flutter build apk` or `flutter build ios`.

4. Fine-Tuning Models (Optional):

   - Fine-tune Gemma 2B on NSFW datasets (e.g., synthetic dialogues) using a desktop setup. Export to TFLite/Core ML and place in `assets/models/`.

**Note**: Due to NSFW content, app store distribution may be restricted. Consider deploying as a Progressive Web App (PWA) or sideloaded build with subtle marketing (e.g., “private chat simulator”).

## Architecture

IntiMate is designed as a cross-platform Flutter app, leveraging on-device AI for privacy and performance. It uses a hidden library of pre-rendered 2D avatars to deliver low-latency, Omegle-inspired video chats with uncensored interactions. All models and assets are stored locally, ensuring offline functionality and privacy.

### High-Level Architecture

1. **Input Layer**:

   - **Camera**: Captures real-time video for facial expressions/gestures (e.g., smile, wink) using MediaPipe FaceMesh or platform-native vision APIs.
   - **Microphone**: Records audio for speech-to-text (STT) and tone analysis (e.g., flirty, excited) via platform-native speech APIs.
   - **Purpose**: Provides user inputs for dynamic, context-aware AI responses.

2. **AI Processing Layer**:

   - **Conversational AI**: Quantized Gemma 2B (\~500MB, 4-bit) or similar small language model, fine-tuned for uncensored, NSFW, flirty dialogue. Processes user text, tone, and gestures.
   - **Visual AI**: Selects pre-rendered 2D avatar sprites from a hidden library and applies Wav2Lip (TFLite, \~50MB) for lip-sync. Triggers animations (e.g., wink) based on inputs.
   - **Emotion/Tone Analyzer**: Lightweight TFLite classifier (\~10MB) detects user emotions (e.g., happy, seductive) from video/audio to adapt responses.
   - **Purpose**: Generates unfiltered dialogue and selects appropriate avatar animations.

3. **Output Layer**:

   - **Video Render**: Displays 2D avatar animations in a video chat UI using Flutter’s CustomPainter or AnimatedBuilder for sprite playback (30 FPS, lightweight).
   - **Audio Output**: Piper TTS (\~100MB) or platform-native TTS delivers expressive, NSFW-tolerant voices (e.g., sultry, playful).
   - **Purpose**: Simulates a live, responsive video call experience.

4. **Session Manager**:

   - Randomly selects an avatar from the hidden library (e.g., “seductive redhead in lingerie”).
   - Enforces 5-10 minute sessions, clearing all data (no storage) for privacy and to prevent emotional dependency.
   - **Purpose**: Ensures randomized, fleeting, Omegle-like interactions.

**Data Flow**:\
User starts session → Session Manager picks random avatar → Camera/Mic → Input Analyzer (CV/STT) → Conversational AI (uncensored reply) → Response Generator (TTS + lip-sync + sprite animation) → UI.\
Example: User says, “You’re hot,” with a smile → AI detects flirty tone/smile, selects “blush” sprite, responds, “Oh, you’re turning me on!” with lip-synced animation.

**Tech Stack**:

- **Framework**: Flutter (UI, cross-platform).
- **AI Frameworks**: TensorFlow Lite (Android), Core ML (iOS), MediaPipe (vision).
- **Models**:
  - Conversation: Gemma 2B (quantized, fine-tuned for NSFW).
  - Visuals: Pre-rendered 2D sprites (PNG/WebP) + Wav2Lip.
  - TTS/STT: Piper TTS, platform-native speech APIs.
  - Emotion: TFLite classifier for sentiment/gesture detection.
- **Rendering**: Flutter CustomPainter for 2D sprite playback.
- **Optimization**: 4-bit quantization, WebP sprite compression, pre-loaded assets for low battery usage (\~10-15% per 10-min session).
